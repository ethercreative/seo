### New Features

You can request new features by submitting an issue with `[FR]` prefix in the title.

### Bugs

If you find a bug, submit an issue and I promise I will get around to it. Eventually.
Make sure you search around to see if the same (or similar) issue exists before 
submitting a new one.

Know how to fix a bug and have too much spare time on your hands? Submit a Pull Request!
Check out the code conventions below before hand.

## Code Conventions

In addition to [Crafts Guidelines](https://github.com/craftcms/docs/blob/v3/en/coding-guidelines.md):

- Use tabs
- Try to keep within the 80 characters line length
- If function arguments or array values can't fit on one line, break each value onto it's own line
- Comment as much as possible

#### JavaScript

In addition to the above:

- Write valid ES6
- Use double quotes `"`

Don't follow my example, try to stick to the above guidelines!
